# Booking API Automation

A simple automation project for testing RESTful APIs related to booking management. The project demonstrates how to build a structured test framework using **Java** and **Rest-Assured**.

## Description

This project provides automated tests for a booking API.  
It includes:
- A **base API class** (`APIBase.java`) that defines reusable configurations.
- A **Booking API class** (`BookingAPI.java`) with methods to interact with booking endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.).
- A **Booking model class** (`Booking.java`) that represents the booking data object.

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate API automation skills using Java.
